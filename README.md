# Spring-MVC

Spring MVC is a JAVA framework that is used to build web applications. It implements all features of the core spring framework like dependency injection, inversion control, etc., and follows the Model-View-Controller design patterns.

### Spring Model View Controller

**Model** - The model contains the core data of the application, data can either be a single object or a group of objects.

**Controller** - The controller contains the business logic of an application.

**View** - The view represents the information in a particular format.

**Front Controller** - In Spring MVC DispatcherServlet class works as a front controller that intercepts the requests and dispatches them to a controller.

## MVC (Model-View-Controller)

MVC is a software architecture. It separates a given software application into three logical components that are model, view, and controller. User input is interpreted by the controller and transformed into a model which is represented to the user by the view.

### View

The view is responsible for all the user interface logic of the application. It presents the data to the end-user in a particular format such as table, chart, dropdown, diagram, etc.

### Controller

The controller performs all the business logic and is responsible for interaction between the view and model components. For example, the controller will take input and manipulate the model data and it will also take data from the model component and provide it to the end-user with the help of the view component.

### Model

The model is the central component of the MVC architecture. It takes instructions from the view through the controller and performs all the data-related logic.


## Spring

Spring is a very popular Java framework name among java developers. Its first version was released in Feb 2003 by Rod Johnson.

Spring Framework is an open-source platform and an application development framework that provides infrastructure support for developing enterprise applications in Java. It enables developers to build applications from "plain old java objects" (POJOs) and allows them to focus on the application as the infrastructure is handled by Spring.

### Java framework

Java framework is the set of pre-written and reusable code in Java programming language which a developer can use for building applications.

Some examples of Java frameworks are:-


- Hibernate
- Grails
- Quarkus
- Apache struts

### Spring framework

Features of the Spring framework are organized into about 20 modules which are grouped into and Test, Instrumentation, AOP, Web, Data Access/Integration, and Core.
